PUSH 1


Current implemented UI features (end‑to‑end):
Landing / Entry Experience
Cinematic full‑screen looping background video with dark tint + rotating subtle gradient overlay.
Animated particle (soft blobs) canvas for depth.
Frosted glass (blur) central panel with translucent border & elevation.
Responsive layout: two fixed‑dimension (360x120) action cards side‑by‑side on wide screens, stacked on narrow (Android phones).
Action cards: gradient backgrounds, hover (web) + press scale animation, hero tags for potential transitions, clamped title/subtitle text.
Headline + subheadline (“GigMeWork” / “People Need People”) centered and adaptive.
Visual & Theming
Material 3 with custom seed‑derived color scheme (teal + violet accents, slate primary).
Consistent card / chip / button theming (rounded shapes, subtle borders).
Light theme surface palette with strong contrast in overlay contexts.
Global responsive typography via theme.
Navigation & Flow
Distinct routes for:
Freelancer sign‑in, client sign‑in
Freelancer/client registration & profile pages
Freelancer home screen
Route table wired in main.dart; landing is home.
Hero tags reserved on action cards (ready for animated transitions to role-specific pages).
Interaction & Animation
Intro fade + slide animation for panel on first load.
Continuous background animation loop.
AnimatedScale on hover/press for cards (web + desktop) with graceful behavior on mobile (tap only).
Job / Domain Functionality (earlier implementation)
Job list screen (CRUD create + list + refresh) using JobService hitting backend REST API (HTTP).
Environment-aware base URL (localhost vs 10.0.2.2) via env.dart.
Auth & Profile (earlier prototype layer)
In‑memory AuthService (user type, simple login state, profile creation flags).
Separate freelancer/client profile creation screens with validation (display name, skills, etc.).
Conditional redirect after login to profile creation if first-time.
Media Utilities
BackgroundVideoSingle widget with graceful loading + darken overlay.
(Legacy) Mosaic multi‑video background implementation (home_choice.dart) still present but now superseded by single cinematic video.
Responsiveness & Platform Parity
Same Dart codebase powering web and Android (no forked UI logic).
LayoutBuilder logic determines card arrangement and widths adaptively.
Hover effects automatically no‑op on touch devices.
Android Integration
INTERNET permission added (network video + API).
Immersive transparent app bar over video on landing.
Code Organization / Theming Infrastructure
Centralized color scheme & component theming (buttons, chips, cards).
Reusable action card & badge avatar widgets.
Particle painter custom painter for lightweight background motion.
Not Yet Cleaned / Legacy (can remove if unneeded)
Older home_choice.dart + earlier gradient/card concept still in repo.
Earlier auth/profile screens may overlap with new flows if both paths are kept.
