PUSH 1


Current implemented UI features (end‑to‑end):
Landing / Entry Experience
Cinematic full‑screen looping background video with dark tint + rotating subtle gradient overlay.
Animated particle (soft blobs) canvas for depth.
Frosted glass (blur) central panel with translucent border & elevation.
Responsive layout: two fixed‑dimension (360x120) action cards side‑by‑side on wide screens, stacked on narrow (Android phones).
Action cards: gradient backgrounds, hover (web) + press scale animation, hero tags for potential transitions, clamped title/subtitle text.
Headline + subheadline (“GigMeWork” / “People Need People”) centered and adaptive.
Visual & Theming
Material 3 with custom seed‑derived color scheme (teal + violet accents, slate primary).
Consistent card / chip / button theming (rounded shapes, subtle borders).
Light theme surface palette with strong contrast in overlay contexts.
Global responsive typography via theme.
Navigation & Flow
Distinct routes for:
Freelancer sign‑in, client sign‑in
Freelancer/client registration & profile pages
Freelancer home screen
Route table wired in main.dart; landing is home.
Hero tags reserved on action cards (ready for animated transitions to role-specific pages).
Interaction & Animation
Intro fade + slide animation for panel on first load.
Continuous background animation loop.
AnimatedScale on hover/press for cards (web + desktop) with graceful behavior on mobile (tap only).
Job / Domain Functionality (earlier implementation)
Job list screen (CRUD create + list + refresh) using JobService hitting backend REST API (HTTP).
Environment-aware base URL (localhost vs 10.0.2.2) via env.dart.
Auth & Profile (earlier prototype layer)
In‑memory AuthService (user type, simple login state, profile creation flags).
Separate freelancer/client profile creation screens with validation (display name, skills, etc.).
Conditional redirect after login to profile creation if first-time.
Media Utilities
BackgroundVideoSingle widget with graceful loading + darken overlay.
(Legacy) Mosaic multi‑video background implementation (home_choice.dart) still present but now superseded by single cinematic video.
Responsiveness & Platform Parity
Same Dart codebase powering web and Android (no forked UI logic).
LayoutBuilder logic determines card arrangement and widths adaptively.
Hover effects automatically no‑op on touch devices.
Android Integration
INTERNET permission added (network video + API).
Immersive transparent app bar over video on landing.
Code Organization / Theming Infrastructure
Centralized color scheme & component theming (buttons, chips, cards).
Reusable action card & badge avatar widgets.
Particle painter custom painter for lightweight background motion.
Not Yet Cleaned / Legacy (can remove if unneeded)
Older home_choice.dart + earlier gradient/card concept still in repo.
Earlier auth/profile screens may overlap with new flows if both paths are kept.


=================================================

push 2

Field-specific error styling (set errorText on password).

Added _authError state.
On failed login with “invalid credentials” or 401 wording, sets _authError to “Invalid email or password.”
Other failures show “Login failed. Please try again.”
errorText wired into the password TextFormField InputDecoration.
Cleared error on field change for immediate feedback.

mplemented field-specific error styling. Possible next enhancements (tell me which, or give another idea):
Shake animation on invalid login
Throttle / lockout after N failed attempts
Highlight email field too when auth fails
Inline “show password” long‑press on mobile
Remember-me persistence (local storage / shared_prefs)
Prefill profile forms with existing data (GET before edit)
JWT auth (hash passwords, token storage, auto refresh)
i18n (localization scaffolding)
Accessibility audit (semantics, contrast)
Password strength meter during registration
Reply with the number(s) or a custom request.


mplemented localization scaffolding (Material localization delegates and supportedLocales) and added shared_preferences plus a preferences service. Haven’t yet wired the remaining enhancements (shake animation, remember-me persistence logic, password strength meter, long‑press reveal, email highlight styling, profile prefill, and using localized strings in sign-in). Please confirm which of the selected items (1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10) you want fully implemented now (all or a subset). Reply with “all” to proceed with every enhancement together, or list numbers.


LOGIN and create profile screens for both freelancer and client roles with the following enhancements implemented:

Done:
Shake animation on invalid login (freelancer & client).
Email field also shows inline error (same message) when credentials invalid.
Long‑press (press & hold) on visibility icon temporarily reveals password; tap toggles as before.
Remember‑me persistence using shared_preferences (stores email + role; auto-fills email when checked).
Password strength meter (freelancer & client registration) with adaptive color + localized labels (Weak/Fair/Good/Strong).
Profile prefill: freelancer & client profile screens fetch existing profile (if any) and populate fields; button text switches to Save when editing an existing profile.
i18n scaffolding: l10n.yaml, intl_en.arb with keys wired into UI (labels, actions, strength labels, error messages, semantics).
Accessibility: semantics labels on sign-in forms, progress indicator is simple; inputs remain labeled; color plus text for password strength.
Field-specific error styling persisted (password & email highlight).
Remember-me preference saved/cleared appropriately.
Minor warnings:
Two RegExp patterns in registration screens had a redundant escape for the dollar sign ($). It’s only a lint warning and won’t break functionality. If you want, we can remove the backslash.
Next optional improvements (let me know which, or ignore):
Throttle/lockout after repeated invalid logins.
Centralize localization string usage across remaining hard-coded texts (e.g., “Welcome back…” headings).
Add unit tests for password strength and remember-me logic.
Add dark theme support with high contrast toggles.
Integrate real secure password hashing & JWT on backend (current plain text).
Implement email validation improvements (RFC pattern) and server-side alignment.
Add multi-language example (e.g., intl_es.arb) to verify l10n pipeline.
If you’d like the RegExp escape cleaned or any of the above items implemented next, tell me which number(s)

SOME CHANGES SUGGESTED BY COPILOT FOR LANDING PAGE


Landing page enhancement ideas (prioritize by impact first):
Performance & resilience
Poster image + low‑res blur-up before video
Adaptive video source selection (HD/SD based on connection)
Fallback static gradient if video fails (retry with exponential backoff)
Prefetch next route assets (sign-in screens) after first paint
Use RepaintBoundary around particle layer to reduce overdraw
Accessibility & UX
Skip to content / keyboard focus outline
Reduce motion flag (disable particles / heavy animations if prefers-reduced-motion)
Proper landmarks (header, main) + semantic heading levels
Visual polish
Parallax depth: slight vertical drift of headline vs cards based on scroll or pointer
Dynamic gradient rotation speed tied to pointer velocity
Optional dark mode toggle with persisted preference
Personalization
If remembered role present, auto-emphasize (scale/pulse) the relevant card
A/B test alternate subtitle copy or CTA ordering
Dynamic content
Inject “Featured Job” or “Recently Hired” ticker in panel
Real-time online freelancers count (lightweight websocket/poll)
SEO / PWA (web)
Structured data (Organization / WebSite JSON-LD)
Better manifest: theme_color, background_color tuned to splash
Meta preconnect for video CDN + backend API
Maintainability
Extract landing layout into smaller widgets: BackgroundLayer, ParticleLayer, ActionPanel
Central config JSON for action cards (title, icon, gradient) to allow remote updates
Analytics / instrumentation
Fire view/impression events when cards enter viewport
Track hover dwell time vs click-through
Security / hardening
CSP-friendly video loading (no unsafe-inline)
Testing
Golden tests for card layout at breakpoints
Performance test: frame build budget under 8ms
Action cards enhancement ideas:
Micro-interactions
3D tilt (Matrix4 on pointer position) with damped easing
Animated gradient sweep on hover (ShaderMask or TweenSequence)
Soft shadow elevation ramp + subtle scale (1.00 → 1.02)
State awareness
“New” / “Recommended” pill badge
Progress ring if an onboarding step incomplete
Accessibility
Full keyboard navigation (focus highlight + Space/Enter activation)
Semantics: role=button, descriptive hint text
Larger tap target (min 48dp) w/ hitTestBehavior
Content variability
Allow secondary text row (dynamic stats: “324 active clients”)
Load remote icon (cached) with shimmer placeholder
Personalization
Reorderable cards (long press drag) stored in prefs
Remember last chosen role and visually accent it
Performance
Wrap each card in RepaintBoundary
Use const gradients & icons where static to avoid rebuild churn
Theming
Gradient variants for light/dark
High contrast mode swap (solid fills instead of gradients)
Feedback
Haptic (mobile) on tap (HapticFeedback.lightImpact)
Long‑press shows quick actions (e.g., “Learn more”, “Docs”)
Implementation quality
Extract ActionCard widget with immutable model (title, subtitle, route, icon, gradient)
Provide factory constructors for role types
Analytics
Fire analytics event with dwellTime + hover → click conversion ratio
Optional sample (3D tilt core idea):
OnListener for mouse/pointer, map local position to small rotation (e.g., rotateX/rotateY up to 6°) with AnimatedContainer or TweenAnimationBuilder.
Reset on exit.
Optional sample (focus ring):
Use FocusableActionDetector + AnimatedContainer to draw an outline when focused.
If you want, specify which items to implement next and I’ll apply code changes.



============================================================================================

Action Card enhacement

Technical notes:
Damped easing uses exponential smoothing each frame (controller repeats every 1600ms purely as a ticker).
Perspective via setEntry(3,2,0.0016) plus rotateX/rotateY based on normalized pointer.
Gradient sweep uses CustomPaint with BlendMode.plus for a luminous pass.
Cleanup handled: controller disposed in dispose().
No analyzer errors detected in main.dart after changes.
